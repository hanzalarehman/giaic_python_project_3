# Streamlit app to evaluate password strength

# The app provides a score and suggestions for improvement.
# The password strength is evaluated based on:
# - Length: Minimum 8 characters
# - Variety: At least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character
# - Common patterns: Avoid common passwords like "1234", "password", etc.
# The score is calculated as follows:
# - 0: Very Weak
# - 1: Weak
# - 2: Fair
